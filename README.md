# cub3d (42 Project)

This project’s objectives are similar to all school 42 first year’s objectives: 
Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc.

As a graphic design project, cub3D enabled me to improve my skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.

Overall, cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics.


This project supports custom textures, sky and ground colors and custom maps with walls and sprites.
